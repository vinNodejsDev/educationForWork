<b>React Hooks were invented by the React team to introduce state management and side-effects in function components.</b>

 It's their way of making it more effortless to use only React function components without the need to refactor a React function component to a React class component for using lifecycle methods, in order to use have side-effects, or local state. React Hooks enable us to write React applications with only function components.

<b>Where the state is kept for hooks?</b>
"Perhaps you’re wondering where React keeps the state for Hooks. The answer is it’s kept in the exact same place where React keeps state for classes. React has an internal update queue which is the source of truth for any state, no matter how you define your components.".
